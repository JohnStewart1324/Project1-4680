# API Security Implementation - Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
- Created `.env` file with actual API key (NOT committed to git)
- Created `.env.example` template file (safe to commit)
- Updated code to read API key from environment variables

### 2. Updated .gitignore
- Verified `.env` and related files are excluded
- These files will NEVER be committed to GitHub:
  - .env
  - .env.local  
  - .env.development.local
  - .env.test.local
  - .env.production.local

### 3. Code Changes
- `renderer/components/AIAnalysis.tsx`
  - Changed from hardcoded API key to: `import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
  - API key is now loaded from .env file at build time

### 4. Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with API setup instructions
- Created `SECURITY.md` with security guidelines
- Created `.env.example` as a template

## 🔐 Security Benefits

✅ **API Key Hidden** - Not visible in source code
✅ **GitHub Safe** - .env file excluded from commits  
✅ **Easy Setup** - Contributors copy .env.example and add their own key
✅ **No Accidental Leaks** - Git will ignore .env automatically

## 📋 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `.env` (your actual key - gitignored)
- `.env.example` (template - safe to commit)
- `SECURITY.md` (security documentation)

**Modified:**
- `renderer/components/AIAnalysis.tsx` (now uses environment variable)
- `README.md` (added setup instructions)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Your .env file is already in place** with your API key
2. **Never edit your API key directly in code files**
3. **Always check git status before committing**
4. **The .gitignore is already configured correctly**

## 🧪 Testing

✅ App rebuilt successfully with environment variables
✅ API key loaded from .env file
✅ Functionality preserved - AI analysis still works
